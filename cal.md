# Content Calendar Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

A native content calendar integrated directly into Sanity Studio, providing a visual timeline of articles and cycling races for editorial planning and content management.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Native Studio Integration (vs External App)
**Decision:** Built as a Sanity Studio tool rather than a separate React application.

**Why:** 
- Single source of truth - no data sync issues
- Editors work within familiar Studio interface
- Direct document navigation from calendar events
- Leverages Sanity's built-in authentication and permissions

### 2. React Big Calendar Library
**Decision:** Used `react-big-calendar` with `moment` localizer.

**Why:**
- Mature, well-maintained calendar component
- Supports month/week/day views out of the box
- Flexible event styling and interaction handling
- Good TypeScript support

### 3. Schema Enhancement Strategy
**Decision:** Added minimal `raceType` schema, kept existing article fields intact.

**Why:**
- Non-disruptive to existing content structure
- Races as separate documents enable better content relationships
- Preserves existing `publishedAt` and `aiGenerated` fields for calendar data
- Future-proof for cycling-specific features (stages, riders, etc.)

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```
components/ContentCalendar.tsx   # Main calendar component with Sanity hooks
plugins/calendar-tool.ts         # Studio tool definition and registration
schemaTypes/raceType.ts         # Race document schema
```

### Data Flow
1. **GROQ Query:** Fetches articles and races in single request
2. **Event Mapping:** Transforms documents into calendar events with color coding
3. **Real-time Updates:** Refresh button re-fetches data, reflects pipeline changes
4. **Navigation:** Click events open documents in Studio for editing

### Color Coding System
- **Green:** Regular articles (human-authored)
- **Orange:** AI-generated articles (`aiGenerated: true`)
- **Red:** Race events (from race documents)

## Integration Points for Automation

### Python Pipeline Compatibility
- Uses existing `publishedAt` field for event timing
- Reads `aiGenerated` boolean for visual differentiation
- No additional API endpoints needed - standard Sanity client works
- Calendar updates automatically as pipeline modifies documents

### Editorial Workflow Support
- Visual overview of planned vs published content
- Race events provide context for article scheduling
- Click-through editing maintains Studio workflow
- Legend helps editors understand content types at a glance

## Benefits Delivered

### For Editors
- Visual content planning interface
- No context switching between tools
- Clear AI vs human content distinction
- Race schedule awareness for content timing

### For Developers
- TypeScript throughout for maintainability
- Clean separation of concerns
- Extensible component architecture
- Standard Sanity patterns for consistency

### For Content Operations
- Single system for planning and publishing
- Real-time pipeline status visibility
- Scalable for high-volume content production
- Integrated with existing content relationships

## Future Extensions

The foundation supports adding:
- Drag-and-drop rescheduling
- Status-based filtering
- Content pipeline stage indicators
- Author/category filtering
- Bulk operations from calendar view

## Key Files Modified

- `package.json` - Added calendar dependencies
- `sanity.config.ts` - Registered calendar tool
- `schemaTypes/index.ts` - Added race schema
- Created 3 new files for calendar implementation

The implementation provides a professional content calendar that enhances editorial workflow while maintaining technical cleanliness for ongoing development.
